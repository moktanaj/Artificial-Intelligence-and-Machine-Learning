### Task to be completed ( Siamese network )
***Dataset used:*** Omniglot dataset
-Split the dataset such that   
 -   the glyphs in ‘train’ split are used for training
 - the glyphs in ‘test’ split are only used for testing. 
 - mplement and test the contrastive loss function described earlier in this document.
 - Implement and test the triplet loss function described in the lecture.
 - Build a Siamese network.
 - Train your Siamese network on the training set. Plot the training and validation error vs time.
 - Evaluate the performance of your network trained with the two different losses by:
 - testing it with pairs from the set of glyphs from the training split
 - testing it with pairs from the set of glyphs from the two splits
 - testing it with pairs from the set of glyphs from the test split
 - Present your results in tables and figures.
